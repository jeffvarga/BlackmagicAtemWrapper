# BlackmagicAtemWrapper
C# wrapper and helpers around the Blackmagic ATEM SDK

This library is meant to wrap the official Blackmagic ATEM binaries, and therefore not meant to be a reverse-engineered UDP library.  Because of this, the library code can easily be integrated into existing projects.

An effort has been made to provide properties, iterators, events, and other simple mechanisms to hide some of the "interesting" COM choices made by Blackmagic.
